# latex-quick-figures package

This makes Latex Figures like wonders.

*Make sure that you have a directory "./figures" that is at least empty.*

*Make sure that your inkscape program is at C:/Program Files/.*

# How to use
In your tex file, make a single line with xy where
*x* is your template number, and *y* is your figure name.
Then, press ctr + alt + o at the end of the line , or Package->Latex Quick Figures-> Make Latex Figure
Make sure that *y* has no spaces in them or it will not be compiled into .pdf_latex format later.

Now your figures are currently in .svg format, so we need to compile them into pdf_latex format, which you can do manually if you want, but we have a command for that, which is Package->Latex Quick Figures->Compile All Figures.
